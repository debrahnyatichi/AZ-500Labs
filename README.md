# 🔒 AZ-500: Azure Security Engineer Labs

## 📘 Overview
This repository contains hands-on lab exercises, notes, and configurations I completed while studying for the **Microsoft Certified: Azure Security Engineer Associate (AZ-500)** certification.  
Each lab focuses on strengthening skills in **identity and access management, platform protection, security operations, and data/application security** within Microsoft Azure.
